## Brief Introduction to wireframing
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.

## Key Elements Found in wireframes
1. **Layout Structure**
   Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.  
   _Example:_ A typical hotel listing page may have a header with a search bar, a sidebar with filters (price, location), a grid layout for hotel cards, and a footer with contact info.

2. **Navigation**  
   Shows how users will move through the site or application.  
   _Example:_ A user can start from the homepage → search results → hotel details → booking page → payment → confirmation.

3. **Content Placement**  
   Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.  
   _Example:_ The hotel name, star rating, and price appear on top of each hotel card, with an image gallery to the left and a "Book Now" button on the right.

4. **Functionality**  
   Outlines key functionalities and interactions.  
   _Example:_ Users can apply filters (e.g., price range or amenities), sort results, view hotel details in a modal, and add bookings to a cart-like system before checkout.

## Types of Wireframes
1. Low-Fidelity Wireframes:
   Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.
2. High-Fidelity Wireframes:
   More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements
