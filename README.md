## Brief Introduction to wireframing
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.

## Key Elements Found in wireframes
1. **Layout Structure**
   Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.  
   _Example:_ A typical hotel listing page may have a header with a search bar, a sidebar with filters (price, location), a grid layout for hotel cards, and a footer with contact info.

2. **Navigation**  
   Shows how users will move through the site or application.  
   _Example:_ A user can start from the homepage ‚Üí search results ‚Üí hotel details ‚Üí booking page ‚Üí payment ‚Üí confirmation.

3. **Content Placement**  
   Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.  
   _Example:_ The hotel name, star rating, and price appear on top of each hotel card, with an image gallery to the left and a "Book Now" button on the right.

4. **Functionality**  
   Outlines key functionalities and interactions.  
   _Example:_ Users can apply filters (e.g., price range or amenities), sort results, view hotel details in a modal, and add bookings to a cart-like system before checkout.

## Types of Wireframes
1. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**  
   These are basic representations of a layout, often hand-drawn or created using simple shapes and lines. They focus on structure, flow, and user interaction rather than design aesthetics.  
   **Used for:**  
   - Early stages of the design process  
   - Brainstorming and idea validation  
   - Fast iterations and feedback  

   _Example:_ A black-and-white sketch showing the placement of the search bar, hotel list, and navigation menu without any styling.

2. **High-Fidelity Wireframes**  
   These are more detailed and polished, resembling the final product. They include specific design elements such as typography, colors, spacing, and sometimes even real content.  
   **Used for:**  
   - Later stages of the design process  
   - Stakeholder presentations and developer handoff  
   - Usability testing  

   _Example:_ A pixel-perfect layout with real hotel names, images, and interactive buttons styled using a UI library.
